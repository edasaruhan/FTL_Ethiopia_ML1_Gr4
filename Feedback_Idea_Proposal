Thank you for the effort and clarity you’ve put into this project proposal — addressing coffee leaf disease in Ethiopia using AI is both locally relevant and globally significant, especially considering Ethiopia's role in global coffee production. Your alignment with SDGs 2, 8, and 13 is well-articulated, and the use of mobile-based deep learning solutions shows a clear intent to deliver actionable, real-time support to farmers. The selection of CNNs and use of an openly available image dataset reflect sound methodological choices for your goal.

To make this project more novel and scalable, consider exploring multilingual voice interfaces or offline model deployment, which could increase accessibility for rural farmers with limited literacy or internet access. You could also enrich your dataset by collaborating with local agricultural institutions to gather region-specific disease variations or temporal data that reflects seasonal patterns. Beyond classification, adding prescriptive analytics — for example, disease severity scoring or suggesting specific treatment options — would significantly enhance the practical utility of your app. Additionally, consider expanding the scope to detect environmental stressors (e.g., drought stress or nutrient deficiency), as many symptoms overlap and are influenced by climate conditions. These extensions would position the app not just as a detector, but as a broader decision-support tool for sustainable farming.
